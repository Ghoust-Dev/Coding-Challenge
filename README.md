### Coding challenge

The project is for manage the products and categories using the Framework Laravel and VueJs.

# Database

Contain 2 tables Product and Category.

# Back-End

I used 2 controllers 'ProductController' and 'CategorieController' to manipulate the code and i used the Repositories and service layer to make a good and fast code and i used the CLI to create and delete the product and categorie from the command ligne.

# Front-End

I used the Vuejs to create the front-end and i used the Axios to receive or send data from the server.

In the folder components we have all components of the project and in the folder routes i create the index.js to manipule the routing of components.

For Styling i used the Bootstrap V4.
